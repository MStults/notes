1. Get the current release pushed out 
	a. Plan what is going to be in it
-DONE 8:29

2. Go over AI
======
	Deterministic (always goes from one state to the next, predictable)
	Bellman Equation 
	v	-> value at a given state
	s 	-> state
	s' 	-> next state
	R(s,a) 	-> reward function 
	v(s) 	-> action a
	gamma 	-> discount factor
	
	v(s) = max(R(s,a) + gamma * v(s'))

======
	Markov Decision Process (MDP)
	Non-Deterministic Search -> 10% chance that it will not do what you want
	
	Markove property
	A stochastic process has a Markove property if the decsion only depends on his current state
	and not a preceeding states	

	Markov Decision Process Equations - is a form of the Bellman Equation 

	Bellman v(s) = max(R(s,a) + gamma * v(s'))

	V(s') = .8 V(s'1) + .1V(s'2) + .1V(s'3)	=> expected value 

	V(s') = sum(p(s,a,s') * v(s')) 	=> expected value 
	p(s,a,s') => probability 

	Markov Decision Non-Deterministic (stochastic) Search Equation 
	v(s) = max(R(s,a) + gamma * sum(p(s,a,s') * v(s')))

=======
	Plan vs Policy 
	Plan -> you know every single step, always do the same thing given the state
	Policy -> Is way to deal with randomness e.g. always move away from the fire even if it takes a longer
	to get to the goal because that way you have no chance of dying

3. Go over Russ's list
	a. Identify any bugs that need to be solved
	b. Badges / FaceBook are next

	Russes List
	Level 21, 51, 56, 62 on golden automaticaly completed the bonus
	Level 21 Right side not usable	
	level 80 needs fixed (text)
	Level 85 challenge cannot get bouns
	Level 59 laser gun error
	Penalty issue with challanges (without producing more than 500ev of bad energy)
--Done 9:35


4. Work on the service
5. Settings - perhaps start the settings project
6. Add-ins will need to look at the local 'DB'
