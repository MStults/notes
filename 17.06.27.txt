1. AI
	Nueral Network
	Back Propergation (adjust the weights)
	Gradient Desent 
	Cost Function - minimize the cost 

	-={Curse of Dimensionality}=-
	the number of weights increase super fast we do not have time to compute them

	Gardient Desent - remember from calculus?

2. ATSM PULL
	-Levels do not have to be updated because the test is about reaching a positive value 
	-Done

3. Release Check List
	Added a simple check list 

4. FS - Short cut 
	This will be a new FS type
